# Changes to make
- Increase maximum speed on ramping (MoveToTask:91)
- Test what biases for forward/strafe/turn should be
- Test actual speed2power (is 0.2 right?)
  - does this change with new wheels?
- make actual slow mode / don't do that anyway
- Play with the slopes on the ramping functions

## real actual splines
> stretch goal
